module TaskRepeater exposing (model, Model, Msg, scheduler, Scheduler, start,update)

{-| Provides a repeatedly running a Task and communicating the results (success
or error) to other parts of a program.

You provide a few pieces of information:
 - the task to run
 - a scheduler for determining when to run the task
 - messages for communicating success and error
 - a message for wrapping internal messages that should come back to the task
   repeater framework
 - a function determining when to continue running the task

Based on these TaskRepeater will repeated execute the task, sending back the
results via the messages you configure it with.

`task` is the task to be periodically executed.
`scheduler` determines when the task will be executed.
`onResult` creates the message that will be issued when the task succeeds.
`onError` creates the message that will be issued when the task fails.
`msgWrapper` creates a message that wraps a Msg so that users can route messages to `update`.
`continue` determines if execution should continue when a result is received.
